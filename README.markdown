## üìÑ Overview

**Philosophia Blog** is a responsive HTML-based website designed as a platform for sharing and exploring philosophical ideas. The site features articles inspired by renowned philosophers such as Nietzsche, Plato, and Alan Watts. Key sections include a main navigation menu, highlights of influential authors/philosophers, a list of the latest blog posts, and a contact area. The visual design is clean and modern, achieved through custom CSS (`main.css`), Fontello icons for social media links, and the "Open Sans" Google Font for typography. While the HTML `lang` attribute is set to "pl" (Polish), some content elements might be mixed or placeholder. The site includes `js/main.js` for potential interactivity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üß≠ **Responsive Navigation Menu**:
    *   A top navigation bar with links to key sections: "Strona G≈Ç√≥wna" (Home), "Pierwszy raz na stronie?" (First Time Here?), "Dlaczego filozofia?" (Why Philosophy?), "O nas" (About Us), and "Kontakt" (Contact).
    *   Designed to be responsive for various screen sizes.
*   üë®‚Äçüè´ **Author/Philosopher Highlights**:
    *   A section dedicated to showcasing influential philosophers (e.g., Kant, Emerson, Nietzsche, Plato, Watts).
    *   Displays images and names of these thinkers, with clickable links (currently placeholders) intended to lead to more information or related articles.
*   üì∞ **Latest Posts Section**:
    *   Presents a curated list of recent blog articles.

*   üì± **Social Media Integration**:
    *   Includes links to social media profiles: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Google+ (note: Google+ is defunct, link should be updated or removed).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Requirements

### Core Technologies:
*   **Structure**: HTML5
*   **Styling**: CSS3 (`main.css`, `css/fontello.css`)
*   **Interactivity (Potential)**: JavaScript (ES6+) (`js/main.js`)
*   **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Open Sans)
*   **Icons**: Fontello (icon font)

### Requirements:
*   **Web Browser**: Any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge).
*   **Internet Connection**: Required to load Google Fonts (Open Sans). Fontello icons also rely on linked font files.
*   **Local Assets**: All specified CSS, JavaScript, image, and Fontello font files must be present in the correct locations relative to `index.html`.
    *   `main.css` (root directory or linked path)
    *   `css/fontello.css` (in `css/` subfolder)
    *   Fontello font files (e.g., `.eot`, `.svg`, `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`) must be in the `css/font/` (or similar, as configured by Fontello) directory relative to `fontello.css`.
    *   `js/main.js` (in `js/` subfolder)
    *   `img/` directory containing all images for authors and posts (e.g., `alan-watts.jpg`, `nietzsche.jpg`, `platon.jpg`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup & Viewing

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your specific details, or simply download the files into a local folder).*

2.  **Ensure Asset Placement**:
    *   Verify that `main.css` is correctly linked in `index.html`.
    *   Confirm that the `css/` subfolder exists and contains `fontello.css` and its associated font files (e.g., in `css/font/`).
    *   Ensure the `js/` subfolder exists and contains `main.js`.
    *   Make sure the `img/` subfolder exists and contains all author and post images (e.g., `alan-watts.jpg`). Check that image paths in the HTML are correct.

3.  **Open in Browser or Host Locally**:
    *   **Directly in Browser**: You can usually open `index.html` directly in your web browser (File > Open File).
    *   **Using a Simple HTTP Server (Recommended for consistent behavior, especially if `js/main.js` involves fetching local resources or has complex pathing)**:
        If you have Python installed, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        Then, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   Alternatively, use any other local web server solution (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code).

## üí° Website Usage & Navigation

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser (ensure an internet connection for Google Fonts).
2.  **Interface**:
    *   **Navigation Menu**: Click links like "Strona G≈Ç√≥wna," "Dlaczego filozofia?," "O nas," or "Kontakt" to navigate to different (potentially placeholder or section-linked) parts of the site.
    *   **Author Highlights**: View images and names of featured philosophers. Clicking these is intended to lead to more information (links are currently placeholders).
    *   **Latest Posts**: Read summaries of recent articles, each with an image. These are static examples; new posts are announced as appearing on Tuesdays and Fridays.
    *   **Contact Section**: Find information for contacting the author, including an "NawiƒÖ≈º wsp√≥≈Çpracƒô" (Establish Cooperation) button (likely a `mailto:` link or placeholder for a contact form).
    *   **Social Media Links**: Click icons to visit (placeholder) Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Google+ profiles.
3.  **Actions**:
    *   Browse the statically presented "latest posts."
    *   Attempt to use the contact section (functionality depends on whether it's a simple `mailto:` link or a placeholder for a form requiring backend setup).
    *   Try the social media links (will lead to placeholder URLs unless updated).
    *   Any further interactivity (e.g., dynamic content loading, animations beyond CSS) would depend on the implementation within `js/main.js`.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

The project is expected to have the following basic file structure:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the homepage, containing all sections.
*   `main.css`: The primary custom CSS file for styling.
*   `css/` (subfolder):
    *   `fontello.css`: CSS styles for Fontello icons.
    *   `font/` (sub-subfolder, or similar): Contains Fontello font files.
*   `js/` (subfolder):
    *   `main.js`: JavaScript file for any client-side interactivity.
*   `img/` (subfolder): Contains all images used for authors, posts, and potentially other site elements.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

## üìù Important Notes & Considerations

*   **Language**: The site's primary content and UI text are in Polish (`lang="pl"`). The description mentions some English content for accessibility, which might refer to code comments or alternative text.
*   **`js/main.js` Functionality**: The specific interactive features provided by `js/main.js` (e.g., for navigation, animations, or dynamic content loading for author/post links) are assumed but not detailed. This file needs to be implemented for such features.
*   **Placeholder Links**: Many links (author highlights, "Read more" for posts, social media, contact button if not a `mailto:`) are currently placeholders and would need to be updated with actual URLs or linked to implemented JavaScript functionality/backend processing.
*   **Image Paths**: Correct paths to all images in the `img/` folder are crucial.
*   **Fontello Setup**: Proper integration of Fontello requires `fontello.css` and all its associated font files to be correctly placed and linked.
*   **Static Nature**: This is a static HTML/CSS/JS website. Dynamic features like user comments, a working contact form that sends emails, or automatic updates of "Latest Posts" would require a backend system (e.g., a CMS, or a static site generator with a content pipeline).
*   **Google Fonts Dependency**: Relies on an internet connection for "Open Sans." Consider local fallbacks.
*   **Preloading**: The note about preloading `main.css` and `fontello.css` is good for performance, but ensure the paths used in the `<link rel="preload">` tags are correct.
